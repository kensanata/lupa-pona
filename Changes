- guess MIME type based on file extension (that is, .txt files are no
  longer served as text/gemini, you need to use .gmi, or some other
  file extension File::MimeInfo doesn't know about)

- new dependency: File::MimeInfo

- use --text_encoding=euc-jp to override UTF-8 charset for all text
  files (all "text" types)
